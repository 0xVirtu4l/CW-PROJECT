                        <p class="lead mb-0">Plant life or total plant cover, An assortment of different plant species and the ground cover they offer make up vegetation. It is a broad phrase that does not specifically relate to any particular taxa, living forms, structure, spatial expanse, or other unique flora or fauna traits.
                            The study discovered that when temperatures rise, low-lying shrubs, grasses, and other plants in the Arctic are growing taller. At wetter than at drier sites, there was a more noticeable increase in height and specific leaf area. Taller Arctic plants catch more snow around them, reducing how hard the earth freezes.
                            Vegetation can affect climate and weather patterns due to the release of water v during photosynthesis. The release of v into the air alters the surface energy fluxes and leads to potential cloud formation.
                            And the Arctic helps to regulate the world’s temperature, so as more Arctic ice melts the warmer our world becomes. These are the facts: Melting ice speeds up climate change. Global warming is causing Arctic ice to melt – ice reflects sunlight, while water absorbs it.

                        <h2>Permafrost</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-0">Permafrost is defined as rock or soil with ice that stays frozen for two or more years. It usually lies below an “active layer” of soil that freezes and thaws every year. And permafrost is mainly found in areas near the Arctic.
                            A warming climate has brought higher temperatures to Alaska and other areas with permafrost, causing some permafrost to thaw. A thawing permafrost layer can lead to severe impacts on people and the environment. It can turn into a mud slurry that cannot support the weight of the soil and vegetation above it. Infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and pipes could be damaged as permafrost thaws.4 Infrastructure damage and erosion, due in part to permafrost thaw, has already caused some communities in western and southern Alaska to have to relocate. Additionally, organic matter (like the remains of plants) currently frozen in the permafrost will start to decompose when the ground thaws, resulting in methane and carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere. This contributes to further global climate change.

                            A recent ABoVE study found that a single fire season in Canada emitted so much carbon into the atmosphere that it offset half of all the carbon removed from the atmosphere through annual tree growth across all of Canada’s vast forests. So not only are wildfires in the Arctic impacted by global warming, they are also in turn contributing to more climate change.

                            Carbon dynamics: It is a component of ecosystem carbon balance that links aquatic and terrestrial systems and represents the largest pool of organic matter in freshwater systems
                            
                            Impacts:
                            Rapid warming in the Arctic is causing carbon-rich soils known as permafrost, previously frozen for millennia, to thaw. As thawing soils decompose, the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane are released into the atmosphere in varying proportions depending on the conditions under which decomposition occurs
                            .By adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are supercharging the natural greenhouse effect, causing global t to rise.

                            Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.
                            
                            Impacts:
                             Wildlife was also synonymous with the game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities. Some wildlife threatens human safety, health, property, and quality of life. However, many wild animals, even dangerous ones, have value to human beings. This value might be economic, educational, or emotional.

                        <p class="lead mb-0">What is Hydrology?
                            Water is one of our most precious natural resources. Without it, there would be no life on earth. Hydrology has evolved as a science in response to the need to understand the complex water system of the earth and help solve water problems. This hydrology primer gives you information about water on Earth and humans' involvement and use of water.

                            Ongoing and expected climate changes in polar regions over the next decade influence and will continue to influence atmospheric circulation, vegetation, and the carbon cycle – and have an impact on the climate system both within and outside the polar regions. The consequences of climate change in these areas are numerous. Sea ice melts, influencing the radiation balance in the global climate system through the albedo effect. Warming may influence bottom water formation. through surface warming and increased input of fresh water; this would have an impact on the “motor” in the ocean system, which in turn defines the framework for the world’s climate. Glaciers melt and contribute strongly toward rising sea levels. Thawing permafrost contributes to the release of greenhouse gases (chiefly methane) that are presently “locked away” underground. Ecosystems are adapted to the climate in a certain area, and climate change will therefore influence ecosystems. However, the various ecosystems in the Arctic will react differently to such changes.

                            1. Summer sea ice is disappearing
                            The extent of sea ice in the Arctic has already declined since 1979, and the sea ice cover continues to be younger and thinner.
                            
                            2. Receding ice creates risks for marine species
                            The declines in sea ice thickness, along with changes in the timing of ice melt, are putting p.
                            
                            3.Sea levels are rising
                            This is due to the melting of ice in the Arctic.
                            
                            4. Arctic communities suffer from food shortages Climate change also affects people. Changes in sea ice, precipitation, snow cover, temperatures and tundra productivity affect the availability of traditional foods. In many Arctic regions, traditional food substitutes cannot be afforded from local sources. Also when rain falls on the snow and freezes, creating an impenetrable ice sheet that prevents animals from accessing their food.
